# ECG Classification using Pattern Recognition

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on the classification of ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals using pattern recognition techniques along with machine learning and deep learning models. The aim is to automatically classify heartbeats into different categories for analysis and healthcare applications.

The complete implementation is provided as a Jupyter notebook developed using Google Colab.

## 📂 Dataset
This project uses the **Heartbeat ECG Dataset** available on Kaggle.

- Dataset Source:  
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat

- The dataset is **not stored in this GitHub repository**.
- It is **downloaded dynamically inside the notebook** using Kaggle utilities during runtime.

This approach keeps the repository lightweight and follows standard machine learning project practices.
